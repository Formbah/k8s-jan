# ReplicationController:
# This is an high level object used for handling multiple replicas of a specific pod. Here we can perform load balancing and scalling.

# ReplicationController uses keys like replicas, template" etc in the "spec" section.

# In template section we can give metadata related to the pod and also use another spec section where we can give containers information.

# Ex: Create  a replication controller for creating 3 replicas of httpd
